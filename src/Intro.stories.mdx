# Introduction to Neu UI

Neu UI is a React component library which follows neumorphic design. The design was originally conceptualised by [Alexander Plyuto](https://dribbble.com/alexplyuto) in late 2019 and "neumorphism", a mixture between skeumorphism and material design, was coined by Michal Malewicz shortly afterwards.

For further information about the design, it's worthwhile taking a look at Alexander Plyuto's guide [here](https://www.figma.com/file/J1uPSOY5k577mDpSfGFven/Neomorphism-Guide-2.0-%7C-Original?node-id=26580%3A1425).

## Installation

Learn how to include Neu UI into your project. You can consume `ui-neu` via npm package by using either `npm` or `yarn`.

```
npm i ui-neu
```

## Importing Components

It's recommended that you import only individual components to avoid unnecessarily importing the entire library.

```jsx
import { Card } from "ui-neu";
```

## Examples
